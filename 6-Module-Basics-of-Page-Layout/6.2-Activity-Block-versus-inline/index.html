<!--
We've provided you with a starter project file. The code is included below, as
well.  It can be opened with the IntelÂ® XDK or see in the CodePen (below)

This simple file has two block level elements (the paragraphs) and two spans,
which are inline. Additionally, there are several classes defined for you.

Try the following:

- Notice immediately each paragraph gets its own line.
- Notice the inline span that follows the paragraph (</p>) starts on its own
  line. However, the second inline span directly follows its predecessor - it
  does not get a new line, it continues on the same line.
- Try applying the brect and prect classes to the elements. (via class="brect" ).
  When applied to the paragraphs, you can see that the classes make the width of
  the paragraph stretch to the edge of the window. It is the same as its parent
  width.  Note that its height is no more than its content.  But the background
  colors and borders are tight to the spans.
- Try applying the w class to each of the elements. This class sets the width
  property. It works on both paragraphs, but it has no effect on the two spans.
- Try applying the h class to each element. This class sets the height property.
  Again, the paragraphs are affected, but the spans are not.
- Apply the pad class to each element. This class sets the padding property.
  The paragraphs are clearly padded. The spans are also padded, but the extra
  padding does not space them out. So if the background colors are still being
  applied, the padded background of one inline element may overlap the other.
  Can you think of a solution that would prevent the overlap?
- Apply the marg-vert class to each element. This class sets the top and bottom
  margins. Note that it works on the block level paragraphs well enough, but has
  no effect on the inline spans.
- Apply the marg-horiz class to each element. This class sets the left and right
  margins.  It works on everything.

Play some more with the elements, trying to appreciate how block and inline
elements differ.

- Try changing the HTML so that the inline elements are inside the block level
  ones.
- Put a margin:0 on the body.
- Have fun!
