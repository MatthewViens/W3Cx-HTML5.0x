Using your favorite browser, navigate to Wikipedia.org. Using the debugger,
change the title and header of the page to "My Wikipedia" and change the
background to light green.
(Hint: use "Inspect" or "Inspect Element" to bring up the debugger).

In another browser window, open up Wikipedia.org. Does it look like the one
you've modified? Why or why not? Did you just break Wikipedia for the rest of
the world?


When opening another tab and navigating back to Wikipedia.org, the page is
redownloaded from the server and looks as you would expect. Changes made
originally through Chrome Developer Tools are only applied locally.
