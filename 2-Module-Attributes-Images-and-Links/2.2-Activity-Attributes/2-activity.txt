Create two paragraphs with the same id and run your code. What happens? We
know the value of the id attribute must be unique, so why does it behave the
way it does? Run your code through the W3C Markup Validator. Does it throw an error?

HTML renderers are very forgiving and will permit duplicate ID's. This can still
cause errors when used with other technologies.

Yes, "Duplicate ID"
